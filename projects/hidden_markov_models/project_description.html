        <h1>HMM for Handwritten Digit Image Classification</h1>
        <p>Given 3 HMMs representing the 0, 1 and 7 digits and sequences of observations, our goal is to classify these observations according to the digits they represent: 0,1 or 7.</p>
        <p>We will be coding the Viterbi algorithm from scratch.</p>
        <p>This work is based on the coursework: TP Markov-HMM Télécom Paris par Laurence Likforman-Sulem, Morgan Buisson, David Perera</p>

        <h2>Data Representation and Model Representation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The handwritten digits are a simplified version of the MNIST dataset.</li>
            <li>The image of a digit is represented by 5x28 pixels each of binary value.</li>
            <li>A digit is modeled by 5 states (from left to right). The states 1 and 5 represent background pixels of value 0. The states 2, 3, and 4 represent the beginning, the middle, and the end of the digit.</li>
            <li>An observation is represented by a column of 5 pixels.</li>
            <li>A state can emit 2<sup>5</sup> = 32 possible observations.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>HMM Models</h2>
        <p>We have 3 HMM Models representing the 0, 1, and 7 digits. Each model corresponds to 3 files, for example, for the 0 model:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A0.txt</strong>: hidden state transition probabilities (5 x 5 matrix)</li>
            <li><strong>B0.txt</strong>: observation probabilities (32 x 5 matrix)</li>
            <li><strong>vect_pi0.txt</strong>: probability of starting from each state (1 x 5 matrix)</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Sequence Representations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The file <strong>matrice_symboles.txt</strong> holds the observation vocabulary i.e. all the possible observations (5 x 32 matrix).</li>
            <li>A sequence of observations is represented by a sequence of numbers indicating the position of the observation in the vocabulary.</li>
            <li>We have 3 files: <strong>SeqTest0.txt</strong>, <strong>SeqTest1.txt</strong>, and <strong>SeqTest7.txt</strong> each containing 10 sequences of the digits they represent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Classification of Handwritten Digit Images</h2>
        <h3>Viterbi Algorithm</h3>
        <p>Given an HMM and a sequence, the Viterbi algorithm calculates the likelihood of the sequence by the given model.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>We have classified 30 images into classes: 0, 1, or 7 (10 images per class) according to the digits they represent.</p>
        <p>With the HMM models we have been provided with, and our implementation of the Viterbi algorithm, we obtained an accuracy score of <strong>0.966</strong>.</p>
