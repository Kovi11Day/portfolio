BASIC CONCEPTS
- history
- state of the art results
- how HMM compare to deep learning
- complexity (algorithm/ how much data is being used?)
- hypothesis (classe d'hypothese)
  - assuming independence of the past
- where are HMMs not applicable because of the hypothesis?
- detail algorithms (in words/ pseudocode):
  - Baume-Welch
  - Forward-Backwards
  - Viterbi

HMMs for TEXT GENERATION
- find financial news dataset to train on
- train using Baume-Welch/Forward-Backwards algorithms
- how do you evaluate language generation?

HMMs for Timeseries Prediction
- find financial dataset to predict
- train using Baume-Welch/Forward-Backwards algorithms
- evaluate
- how does this compare to other methods?
- (confidence interval of model)
